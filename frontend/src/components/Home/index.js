                <h3>Explore objective sentencing trends by individual judges, counties, and crimes â€” built from scraped public records. Allowing individuals to do their own research and make up their own minds.</h3>
                <h3>Data from individual defense attornies / prosecutors in progress. Instead of 3 vs 4.5 stars hire your attorney based on their outcomes compared to the state average.</h3>

                <h2>Do certain counties over prosecute or have aberrations in sentencing?</h2>
                <h2>Do Public Defenders actually get worse outcomes compared to Private attornies?</h2>
                <p>using public records and scrapped data from open source background sites.  Quantitative Justice is interested in answering these questions with objective statistical data</p>
                <p>all data sets are free to download although names of defendents and identifying information of victims have both been anonymized.  We are not a background check site.</p>
